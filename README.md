# GGSEA
Generalized Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GGSEA) is a novel bioinformatics method used to determine whether a predefined set of genes shows statistically significant differences between two biological states, such as different phenotypes or conditions.

This method helps researchers understand the underlying biological processes and functional significance of genes by analyzing large-scale gene expression data. GGSEA aggregates the signal across groups of related genes, increasing the statistical power of the analysis.
